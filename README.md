# Remix + Nuvo demo ðŸŽ‰

This repo demonstrates how to get Nuvo working with Remix from the starter template (`npx create-remix@latest`).
Note that manual routing has been configured in `vite.config.ts`.

## Setup

Install modules:

```bash
npm install
```

## Add license key

Create a `.env` file and add the following:

```js
NUVO_LICENSE_KEY=<your-license-key>

```

## Start the dev server

Start Remix by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```
